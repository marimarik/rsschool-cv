## Summary 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am interested in web development. My wish is to gain new knowledge and skills to solve software issues quickly and efficiently.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me it is important to have a quiet, friendly environment. My strengths are that I am hard working, responsible, problem-solving and a team player. I am a careful listener and a fast learner.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My goal is to enter the international IT market and to gain appropriate experience in Frond-End development starting as a Junior Developer. Currently I am following the Rolling Scopes Training Program and at the end of this course I hope to have an opportunity to join EPAM team.
